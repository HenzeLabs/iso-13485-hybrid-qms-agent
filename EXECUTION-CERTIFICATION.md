## 📞 SUPPORT

If any command fails during execution:

1. **Check error message carefully** — it will tell you exactly what failed
2. **See SCMP-PRE-MERGE-EXECUTION.md** — Troubleshooting section covers common issues
3. **Common fixes:**

   ```bash
   # If npm commands fail, try:
   npm install                    # Reinstall dependencies

   # If linting fails:
   npm run lint                   # See specific errors
   npx prettier --write "portal/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"  # Auto-format

   # If build fails:
   npx tsc --noEmit              # Check TypeScript errors

   # If git commit fails (GPG):
   git config user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```
